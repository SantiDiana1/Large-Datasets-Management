# Large-Datasets-Management

In this repository will be located the notebook that I completed for large scale datasets management. This noteboook contains a project developed in the context of the Master in Sound and Music Computing in UPF (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona). 

## Explanation
[Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) is an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public. As you can believe, the amount of information that this dataset contains is huge. That's why some handling techniques have to be applied to be able to select data or do whichever task you want to do with the data.

In this project, I had some CSV files that were more than 20Gb big, and I wanted to select data from them (map data, select only some of the lines, select only some of the rows...) in the most efficient way. This is the task that is shown in the notebook.

If any clarification is needed please contact me in this email: dianasanti0@gmail.com.

Cheers!
